  **Note**:

      Some of you, when start to run **```python manage.py migrate```**, will get a error like: ```ModuleNotFoundError: No module named _sqlite3```. This occurs cause, for somehow, the package sqlite3 wasn't installed. 

  **Linux**
  
    - First, run this code on your console:
      - ```apt-get install libsqlite3-dev```
  
    - Download the Python in tar.xz extension and extract it. 
  
    - Go to downloaded python source and run this command: 
      - ```./configure --enable-loadable-sqlite-extensions && make && sudo make install```
